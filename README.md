Codejudge
=========
Coding competitions are now easy to organise anytime, anywhere.

Codejudge can be run from any PHP, MySQL server and can be used to power any coding competition and evaluate its solutions automatically.

No need to run to big companies to host your event. You can set up Codejudge almost anywhere and anytime!

### Note

Bleeding edge changes are on the `develop` branch and things most likely don't work there. You are recomended to use the `master` branch. If you love to experiment then go for the `develop` branch.

A follow-up project to create a better judge was being worked on, but kind of stalled at the moment (due to lack of time from my side). Take a look at [judgev2](https://github.com/sankha93/judgev2)
